## Background
Financial fraud is a prevalent issue in the financial industry, causing significant losses for both financial institutions and consumers. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to detect sophisticated fraud patterns, leading to increased risks and liabilities. To address this challenge, this project employs advanced data engineering techniques to build a robust fraud detection system capable of identifying fraudulent activities in real-time.

## Objectives
Specifically, the project aims to address the following key objectives:

- Extract relevant data elements from the EIA-923 report and transform them into a structured format that is suitable for analysis and modeling.
- Standardize the data and ensure that it is consistent, accurate, and complete.
- Load the transformed data into a data warehouse or database that can be easily queried and analyzed.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for accessing and querying the data, enabling users to generate reports and visualizations that can support decision-making.
- Provide quick insight on the dataset \

## Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-fraud-detection.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the environment variables required for connecting to data sources and APIs.
4. Run the data preprocessing pipeline to prepare the dataset for modeling.
5. Train and evaluate machine learning models using the processed dataset.
6. Deploy the trained models to the production environment for real-time fraud detection.

## Usage
To use the project, follow these guidelines:
- Provide input data containing transactional information in a structured format.
- Execute the fraud detection pipeline to analyze the data and generate fraud predictions.
- Monitor the system dashboard for real-time insights and alerts on suspicious activities.
- Investigate flagged transactions and take appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent fraud.
